# Personal Website

My personal website and blog built with HTML and CSS.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `blog/` - Blog section
- `styles.css` - Styling for the entire site

## Development

To run locally, simply serve the files using any HTTP server. For example:

```bash
python -m http.server
# or
npx serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
