# Personal Website

My personal website and blog built with HTML.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `blog/` - Blog section

## Development

To run locally, simply serve the files using any HTTP server. For example:

```bash
npx serve -l 3005
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3005` in your browser.
